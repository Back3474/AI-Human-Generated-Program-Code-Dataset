    "prompt": "Solve the following problem with C++ code. Class name: Solution, Method name: int maximumScore(vector<int>& nums, int k).\n\nYou are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.\n\nInitially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:\n\nChoose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.\nChoose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.\nMultiply your score by x.\nHere, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.\n\nThe prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.\n\nReturn the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.\n\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2\nOutput: 81\nExplanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:\n- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray.

Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2].

If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.\nMultiply your score by x.\nHere, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.\n\nThe prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.\n\nReturn the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.\n\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2\nOutput: 81\nExplanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:\n- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray.

Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.\nIt can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3\nOutput: 4788\nExplanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: \n- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.\n- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.\n- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2].

If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.\nMultiply your score by x.\nHere, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.\n\nThe prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.\n\nReturn the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.\n\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2\nOutput: 81\nExplanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:\n- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray.

Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.\n- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5].
